## What are fractals?

# Michael Albrecht


*Note: This is the first of many blog post I am making during my research with [Christian Ferko](https://physics.uchicago.edu/people/profile/christian-ferko/). Throughout these posts, I will report my findings and takes on materaials and dsicussions motivated from our lectures and research.

During my sophomore and junior year in high school, my high school choir director often liked to mention fractals, ojects that are self-similar: objects that look the same on different scales. For example, this gif shown here:[Zoomed-in Snowflake](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Kochsim.gif) shows an animation of zooming into a certain fractal known as the Koch snowflake, or Koch curve.
